# ü§ñ Contributions GitHub Bot :
<br>

**Does your GitHub Graph looks like a noob with a few number of Commits and Push? Do you want to have your contribution graph with lots of commit like pro, let's go.**<br>

## üìù Introduction
 
The project uses [OS(module)-python](https://docs.python.org/3/library/os.html), Programs that import and use 'os' stand a better chance of being portable between different platforms. Of course, they must then only use functions that are defined by all platforms (e.g., unlink and opendir), and leave all pathname manipulation to os.path (e.g., split and join).

## üõ†Ô∏è Installation

Clone and fork the repository to make the changes in your local system.

```git-bash
git clone https://github.com/utsanjan/Github-Contribution-Bot
cd Github-Contribution-Bot
```

Finally, run the project to see what the moment package does.

```python
python main.py
```
